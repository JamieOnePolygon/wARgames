A recreation of the iconic tabletop game; Battleships, on mobile phones using Augmented Reality technology to add new life to the game.
Created in Unity3d to be pulished to mobile devices.

Planned Features:
- Classic Battleships gameplay.
- Multiplayer (using Unity Networking to begin with)
- Addition game modes where new features are added. **These are to be added after**
  - Varying shot-effect based on a selected game piece (For example: Submarines fire a torpedo that travels down a Row/Column that will         explode when it enters a cell with a game piece)
